E-commerce Sales Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of online 
sales performance, including key metrics such as total revenue, order volume, 
top-selling products, customer trends, and sales by region.

2.) Short Description of dshboard

The Power BI E-commerce Sales Dashboard visually presents key sales data such as revenue, orders, customer trends, and product performance to help track and analyze online business performance.

Purpose:
To provide real-time insights into e-commerce sales, enabling data-driven decisions, identifying top-performing products, monitoring customer behavior, and optimizing sales strategies.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:                                                         . Power BI dasktop: Main data visualization platform used for report creation 

. Power Query: Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping preparing the data 

. File Format: .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4.) Data Source

I have created a sales dataset that includes detailed information such as 
Order ID, State, Customer Name, Product Category, Amount, Date, and many other 
relevant fields. This dataset is designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance,
track customer behavior, monitor regional sales trends, and evaluate product category-wise 
performance over time. It serves as the foundation for building insightful dashboards and 
reports using Power BI.
